      "Dr. Hartman really knows what she is doing. She is a gifted and extremely caring dentist who takes the time to understand you, and to thoroughly explain everything about what she is finding and what she proposes to do. Her caring and thorough approach is demonstrated also by everyone else in the office. I feel so very fortunate to have her and her team as my dental support."

      "Hands down, this is the most welcoming dentist office I've seen in the DMV area, particularly in DC! I mean, since when dentist office started to provide an inhouse playground for kids and a massage chair for adults? Just see the pics!! And the doc, Dr Mahmood herself, so kind and patient with my kids. True professional! She does accept Medicaid clients, FYI!"
