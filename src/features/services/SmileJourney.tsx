        A dental emergency exam is necessary for issues like severe tooth pain,
        signs of infection (such as gum irritation or jaw swelling), or trauma
        that fractures a tooth. These symptoms require immediate attention to
        address potential infections or damage effectively.
      </h1>
      <h1 className="text-center text-xl">
        During an emergency visit, the dentist performs targeted X-rays and a
        focused examination to diagnose the problem and provide immediate
        relief. In some cases, a referral to a specialist is needed. Regular
        checkups and cleanings can help prevent such emergencies by catching
        issues early when they are easier to treat.
