            Usually, treatment can be done or started on the <b>same day</b> as

            dentist. However, a complex medical history or complex treatment
            needs may require a second appointment to provide treatment on
            another day.

            We know that life can get busy, so we offer evening and weekend

            we&apos;ve got you covered! For many patients, treatment can be
            completed or started on the same day as the consultation, saving you
            an extra trip to the office. However, more complex cases may require
            follow-up visits.
