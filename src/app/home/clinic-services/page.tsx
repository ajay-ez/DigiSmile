                  Dental fillings serve as the remedy for cavitiesâ€”those small
                  but impactful holes in teeth. Our process involves adeptly
                  removing decay, replacing it with a material that safeguards
                  against future decay, and shields the tooth&apos;s root and
                  internal structures from bacterial harm. Experience the
                  strength and health our fillings bring to your smile.

                <Text as={"h4"} mt={6}>
                  Concerned about pain during the filling process? Fear not.
                  With the use of local anesthesia, dental fillings are
                  typically painless. Small cavities may not even require
                  anesthesia. Feel free to discuss any concerns with our
                  dentists beforehand for a more comfortable experience.

                  he bonding or filling material is a composite resin that
                  mostly matches the color of your teeth. It is used to bond
                  teeth or fill the cavity. It is also very effective for making
                  aesthetically pleasing changes. Once the resin composite is
                  applied, it is shaped to appear natural and blend in. Once
                  cured, it forms a strong bond and can last for 7-8 years with
                  proper care.

                  When you apply a whitening solution to your teeth, the
                  hydrogen peroxide in the solution penetrates the enamel. The
                  oxidation process then begins, in which molecules are altered
                  to reflect less or no light. This gives them a colorless
                  appearance and white teeth. This method is quite good at
                  removing stains and can be performed several times.

                  There are many reasons for discolored teeth. Some people
                  naturally have a yellow bone color, while other people are
                  smokers or frequent coffee drinkers. This can leave obvious
                  and uncanny stains on your teeth. The teeth whitening process
                  is quite simple and can be done by the dentist in just one
                  visit.

                  A dental veneer is a thin covering that is placed on the front
                  part of the tooth. It matches your teeth in color, shape, and
                  size. Dental Veneer blend in perfectly with your teeth and are
                  very hard to detect.

                <Text as={"h4"} mt={6}>
                  To start, the dentist cleans and preps your tooth for the
                  procedure. The dentist ensures that there is enough space to
                  bond a veneer; they have to file a bit in some cases. A
                  temporary veneer is created using removable glue. During that
                  time, the patient has to take special care and avoid hard
                  foods. The temporary veneers are worn for a few days to figure
                  out any problems or wrong angles. After that, the actual
                  veneer is fabricated and ready to be bonded to the tooth.

                  Why do people choose veneers?
                </Text>
                <Text as={"h4"} mt={6}>
                  Dental veneers are so much more effective than filling or
                  bonding. Veneers are more aesthetically pleasing and good for
                  appearance. Veneers transform a person&apos;s smile from
                  average to very eye-catching and attractive.

                  A comprehensive exam and cleaning are part of regular dental
                  care. Itâ€™s important to visit your dentist regularly to ensure
                  your oral health is in good condition. During this scheduled
                  checkup, your dentist will examine your teeth, gums, and other
                  aspects of oral health, including screening for oral cancer.
                  They will also review any previous procedures that may have
                  been performed. After the evaluation, your dentist will advise
                  you on any necessary treatments.

                <Text as={"h4"} mt={6}>
                  The procedures during a dental examination depend on the
                  condition of your teeth and your oral history. You can expect
                  general X-rays, such as bitewing X-rays, to detect tooth
                  decay. If you have had previous procedures, your dentist may
                  take an X-ray of a specific tooth. Other procedures may
                  include oral photos for face profiles or intraoral photos. The
                  visit usually includes a thorough cleaning and is followed by
                  advice on any additional procedures you might need.

                <Text as={"h4"} mt={6}>
                  A thorough cleaning is a standard procedure that does not
                  require special medication. The dentist uses scalers or sonic
                  handpieces to remove plaque and built-up calculus, followed by
                  flossing and polishing the teeth.

                <Text as={"h4"} mt={6}>
                  The main difference between regular and deep cleaning is that
                  deep cleaning is more extensive and is performed when
                  periodontal issues such as deep pockets and bone loss are
                  detected. A maintenance schedule of every three months is
                  usually recommended after a deep cleaning.
